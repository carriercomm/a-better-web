# A Better Web

Apart from the usual ad blocking lists, I use [uBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/) to hide everything I don't like in a website - odd navbars, sidebars, footers and whatnots.

This is my custom filters list sorted site-wise.

## Usage

Install uBlock, go to Settings -> My Filters.

Click "Import and Append" and select the filter.txt file.

Enjoy!

## Status

I constantly add new rules, but exporting them and then sorting them correctly is boring so I don't update this repo as often. Now, if only I wrote a python script that could do that for me, things would be different...
